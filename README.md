# Money Grabber AR
 An Augmented Reality game in which you must grab coins on pre-scanned surfaces.

# The Game
Money Grabber AR is a Game for mobile devices in which you must collect coins placed randomly on pre-scanned surfaces.


Time-based mode : You must collect as much as you can coins in 1 minute.

A 8 Coin mode : You must collect a series of 8 coins in the shortest possible time.


# Scan
Before each mode you must Scan your Room / Environment to detect surfaces.
An Area Level will be assigned to your scan.
The bigger the surface is, the bigger the challenge will be!


# Play
Press Play and the game will start.
Coins will be placed randomly in your environment,
Search for them and Grab them by getting close!

If you can’t find them, don’t worry, after a certain amount of time you will receive some hints about the position of the closest coin to you.

Try the different modes, Challenge your friends and Share your score with them!


The game has been developed in Unity using the new Cross Platform API 
AR Foundation. Lot of functionalities from ARCore and ARKit are currently missing, but it is constantly updating.
Quality of the scan largely depends on the size of the surfaces and on the lacking of vertical surfaces in the environment.
